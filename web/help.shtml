Genes and proteins from the following ten organisms can be searched using gene names 
or systematic identifiers from the corresponding Model Organism Database (MOD), Ensembl, 
NCBI or UniProt: 
<em>H. sapiens, M. musculus, R. norvegicus, A. thaliana, C. elegans, D. discoideum, 
D. melanogaster, P. falciparum, E. coli, S. pombe, and S. cerevisiae</em>.  
It is possible to search with identifiers and names from 
<a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/">MGI</a> for mouse, 
<a href="http://rgd.mcw.edu/">RGD</a> for rat, 
<a href="http://www.arabidopsis.org/">TAIR</a> for Arabidopsis, 
<a href="http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu/">FlyBase</a> for fly, 
<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/">WormBase</a> for worm, 
<a href="http://dictybase.org/">dictyBase</a> for Dictyostelium, 
<a href="http://www.genedb.org/genedb/malaria/index.jsp">GeneDB</a> for Plasmodium, 
<a href="http://ecogene.org/index.php">EcoGene</a> for <em>E.coli</em>,
<a href="http://www.genedb.org/genedb/pombe/index.jsp">GeneDB</a> for <em>S. pombe</em>, 
and <a href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/">SGD</a> for <em>S. cerevisiae</em>.  
For mouse MGI identifiers please prefix the number with "MGI:", and for rat RGD 
identifiers, prefix the number with "RGD:".  For human, mouse and rat, it is also 
possible to search with 
<a href="http://www.ensembl.org/">Ensembl</a> protein IDs.  Some other identifiers 
also work when searching for organisms including 
<a href="http://www.ebi.uniprot.org/index.shtml">UniProt</a> accession numbers and 
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=Protein">NCBI protein GI</a> 
identifiers.  For NCBI GI identifiers, please prefix the number with "GI:".  However, 
some of the searches may be limited by the quality of links to these databases from 
the relevant model organism database.  GO information comes from the 
<a href="http://www.geneontology.org/">Gene Ontology</a> home page.
</p>
<p>
YOGY is implemented in a MySQL relational database running on a UNIX server.  Data for 
the external resources have been downloaded from the associated FTP and websites for 
import into this database.  The data model has been validated to identify and remove 
potential problems such as many-to-many relationships.  It uses perl scripts together 
with the perl DBI module for file import.  For queries, we have designed a web interface 
using the CGI module of perl, hosted on an Apache server.  The perl GD graphics module 
is used for bar charts.
</p>
<p>
Genes and proteins from the above nine organisms can be searched using gene names 
or systematic identifiers reported in the databases indicated above.  Where 
possible, identifiers from the same MOD are shown throughout the output so that proteins 
from the five data sources can be checked for consistency; this is useful as the 
different homology resources use identifiers from a variety of databases.  Because of 
the ambiguity of many identifiers, legacy naming systems and revisions to gene structures 
and gene complements, it is not always possible to be certain whether some apparent 
differences in orthology calls are, in fact, equivalent proteins.  Whilst we have made 
every effort to map these identifiers automatically using resources from the MOD, the 
<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/IPI/IPIhelp.html">International Protein Index</a>, 
<a href="http://www.ebi.uniprot.org/index.shtml">UniProt</a>, and the 
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=gene">NCBI Gene database</a>,
any discrepancies should be checked manually by the user.  It is possible to use incomplete 
names with a wild-card option, providing a list of genes and one-line descriptions for 
further search.
</p>
<p>
GO terms annotated to the identified orthologs can also be retrieved. Only associations using 
experimental and curator validated evidence codes are included.  The option to show GO terms 
is switched off by default due to the increased time required to download GO data.  Options are 
provided to display GO terms in separate tables at the end of each resource, or in a single 
table at the end of the output.
</p>
<p>
The output is provided in tabulated HTML format.  The first table contains general 
information for the protein of interest including description and links to the 
corresponding MOD and the UniProt database, if this accession number is available.  
For <em>S. pombe</em>, links to gene expression profiles during 
the cell cycle (C), meiotic differentiation (M), and stress conditions (S) are also 
provided.  The data sources which provide positive orthology results for the gene of 
interest are then specified with links to the corresponding outputs.
</p>
<p>
The orthology results are presented in a standard output format for each dataset.  At 
the top is information about the query protein cluster(s), followed by a list of 
available orthologs ordered by organism together with links to the original databases.  
Links to UniProt are also provided if the accession number is available.  Below, each 
data source is mentioned in the order given in the output page.
</p>
<p>
For <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/new/">KOGs</a>, the summary table starts 
with the unique KOG name together with a link to the website.  The next column displays 
a bar chart of the ortholog numbers for each organism, revealing the phylogenetic pattern 
for the KOGs.  This chart also provides a link to a list of other KOGs that share the 
same phylogenetic pattern, which may help to understand how the protein has been 
conserved through evolution.  The summary table also indicates the functional 
classification, with a link to other KOGs in this classification, and a one-line 
description for the KOG.  The orthologs are displayed in a list below the summary table, 
together with links for each protein or domain to the corresponding KOG cluster 
alignments and to the relevant protein page at NCBI.
</p>
<p>
For <a href="http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se/">Inparanoid</a>, we excluded orthologs from 
largely unannotated organisms, which are not 
in the other homology resources; this reduces the output page to 18 organisms (20 
databases as both mouse and rat are include two datasets).  The bar 
chart on top shows the phylogenetic pattern for the orthologs.  The list underneath shows 
the orthologs for the query protein, links to the Inparanoid protein clusters for each 
organism, the Inparanoid score, and a link to the protein page in the corresponding MOD.  
Inparanoid uses a sophisticated methodology to distinguish between in- and out-paralogs; 
we have downloaded the tables from the Inparanoid website and present these 
pre-calculated datasets on the YOGY website.
</p>
<p>
For <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?DB=homologene">Homologene</a>, 
the summary at the top provides a link to the query protein cluster at NCBI.  Each 
ortholog is then presented by organism with links to the relevant NCBI pages
</p>
<p>
For <a href="http://orthomcl.cbil.upenn.edu/">OrthoMCL</a>, we have again excluded 
orthologs from largely unannotated organisms and prokaryotes (except 
<em>Escherichia coli</em>, which is also included in Inparanoid) reducing the output 
to 24 organisms.  The summary table includes a link to the OrthoMCL cluster and a 
phylogenetic bar chart.  This table is followed by a list of orthologs in the cluster 
with a link to the original protein sequence used for clustering and a link to the 
relevant MOD.  For some of the less well characterised yeasts, which have no MOD, 
a link is provided to either the 
<a href="http://wolfe.gen.tcd.ie/ygob/">"Yeast Gene Order Browser"</a> or 
<a href="http://cbi.labri.fr/Genolevures/">G&#233;nolevures</a> that both provide 
graphical representations of conserved genome location.
</p>
<p>
For the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_pombe/">curated yeast ortholog</a> 
dataset, only fission and budding yeast proteins are included.  The output provides 
the lists of orthologs together with links to the 
<a href="http://www.genedb.org/genedb/pombe/index.jsp"><em>S. pombe</em> GeneDB</a> and 
<a href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/">SGD</a> databases.
